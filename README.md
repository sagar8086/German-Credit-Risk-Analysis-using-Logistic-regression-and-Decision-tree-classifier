# German-Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Logistic-regression-and-Decision-tree-classifier

Data: The German credit scoring data is a dataset provided by Prof. Hogmann. The data set has information about 1000 individuals, on the basis of which they have been classified as risky or not.

Goal: Compare the performance of logistic regression and decision tree classifier models on predicting the risk of the loans for 1000 individuals.

Major Findings:

• The logistic model provided an in-sample misclassification rate as a 35.28% and out-of-sample misclassification rate as 37.33%.

• The CART model provided an in-sample misclassification rate as a 30.42% and out-of-sample misclassification rate as 46.67%.

• On using the different split ratios (80:20), we observed a decrease in out-of-sample misclassification for both models.
